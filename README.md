Rock Paper Scissors game testing

This is a Rock Paper Scissor game. 
First, you have to enter a player name for the game to start.
Then you will have three clickable buttons to choose between: "Rock", "Paper" or "Scissors" and depending on what the computer determines, you either win, lose or draw! The computer's choice is randomized between the three values.
Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors beats paper. If both the player and the computer choose the same value then it's a tie.
After each game the score is updated with +1 depending on who won, unless it's a tie, then the scores remain unchanged. You can play for as long as you like, there is no maximum score to reach.
Lastly, you can reset the score to start a new game if you like with the reset button. You will have the same name as you chose from the beginning but the scores will go back to 0.
If you want to choose a new player name, you need to refresh the page instead.
